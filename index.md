## About

I am a researcher and lecturer in the computational humanities. I apply mixed methods to solve social, ethical, and development questions related to ML, AI, and algorithmic culture. I am passionate about the impact of datafication on society, particularly in the context of norms and practices in everyday life.

I am currently working as a Project Scientist and Lecturer at UC Berkeley's [Social Science Data Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home), leading the curriculum of our portfolio of 30+ workshops in AI, computational social sciences, and Digital Humanities. I have developed and taught courses for learners across the world, including in Shanghai, Copenhagen, and Sydney.

My research uses mixed methods to investigate norms in language models, and explore perceptions of AI systems. Previous research projects include a Research Associate position in the [Discovering and Attesting Digital Discrimination](https://dadd-project.github.io/) project at King's College London (2019-2022) and a researcher-in-residence position for the UK's [National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online](http://rephrain.ac.uk) (2022).

## Books

My Ph.D. was on contemporary ideologies surrounding leisurely travel, and their recalibration through digital technology. My first book, [Scripted Journeys](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110700497/html?lang=en), on hypermediated tourism and the construction of authenticity, was published by De Gruyter in 2021. My second book, [Traveling Through Video Games](https://www.routledge.com/Traveling-through-Video-Games/vanNuenen/p/book/9781032519500?srsltid=AfmBOoquQqJ5DLtwAhMaGtC3yjdMapsStB_WdFZXZKDRQFu44A1a1lDi), on the influence of the promotional language of tourism on video game design, was published in 2023.
