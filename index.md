## Hello, I'm Tom.

I am a researcher and lecturer in cultural analytics and accountable data science. I apply mixed methods to solve social, ethical, and development questions related to ML, AI, and algorithmic culture. I am passionate about the impact of datafication on society, particularly in the context of fairness and discrimination.

Recent research projects include a Research Associate position in the [Discovering and Attesting Digital Discrimination](https://dadd-project.github.io/) project at King’s College London (2019-2022) and a researcher-in-residence position for the UK’s [National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online](http://rephrain.ac.uk) (2022). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing methods to investigate language biases, investigating perceptions of unfair treatment by AI systems, and running workshops on linguistic biases in ML systems.

I am currently working as a Project Scientist and Lecturer at UC Berkeley's [Social Science Data Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home), developing workshops and teaching courses on computational social science in Python and R. As an educator, I have onboarded and coached learners from non-technical backgrounds into data science through courses and workshops across the world, including in Shanghai, Copenhagen, and Sydney.

My Ph.D. was on contemporary ideologies surrounding leisurely travel, and their recalibration through digital technology. My [book](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110700497/html?lang=en) on hypermediated tourism and the construction of authenticity was published by De Gruyter in 2021.
