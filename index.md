## About

I am a researcher and lecturer in the computational humanities. I apply mixed methods to investigate social, ethical, and development questions related to ML, AI, and algorithmic culture. I am passionate about the impact of datafication on society, particularly in the context of norms and practices in everyday life.

At UC Berkeley, I lead the curriculum of 30+ workshops in AI, computational social sciences, and Digital Humanities. I also teach in the new [Master of Computational Social Science](https://macss.berkeley.edu/) program. I have taught courses and workshops across three continents, including visiting positions at universities in Shanghai, Copenhagen, and Sydney.

My research investigates norms in language models and perceptions of AI systems. Recent work on LLM value alignment and moral reasoning has been published at NeurIPS and ACM FAccT. I also serve as an editor for [Tourist Studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/tou).
