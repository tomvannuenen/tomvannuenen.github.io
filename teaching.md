I develop and teach courses and workshops in Digital Humanities and computational social science, making data science accessible to researchers from non-technical backgrounds. I've taught across three continents: at UC Berkeley (USA), King's College London (UK), Tilburg University (NL), and universities in China, Denmark, and Australia.
