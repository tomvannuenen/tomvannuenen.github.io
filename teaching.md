# Teaching

I develop and teach computational social science courses and workshops, focusing on making data science accessible to researchers from non-technical backgrounds. I've taught learners across the world, including in Shanghai, Copenhagen, and Sydney.

## D-Lab Workshops

At UC Berkeley's [Social Science Data Lab (D-Lab)](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/home), I develop open-source workshops on Python, R, and computational methods for social science research.

**All 30+ workshops are freely available on GitHub:**

### Featured Workshops

**Python**
- [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals) - 12-hour introduction to Python for data analysis
- [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling) - Data manipulation with Pandas

**R**
- [R Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals) - 8-hour introduction to R programming
- [R Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Data-Wrangling) - Data manipulation with tidyverse

**Other Topics**
- [Bash & Git](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Bash-Git) - Command line and version control basics
- [Getting Started With AI](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Getting-Started-With-AI) - Introduction to AI tools for research
- [Computational Social Science Training Program](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program) - Year-long program covering ML, NLP, and causal inference

## Interactive Demos

I created interactive demonstrations for teaching advanced computing concepts. These browser-based tools help students understand complex topics through hands-on exploration.

### Available Demos

- **Git & GitHub** - Version control, branching, and team collaboration workflows
- **Web APIs** - Understanding REST, authentication, rate limiting, and API integration
- **Web Scraping** - Extract structured data from websites using Python and BeautifulSoup
- **TF-IDF Analysis** - Measuring document importance and extracting key terms from text
- **Word Embeddings** - How computers learn word meanings through context and training
- **Transformer Attention** - Understanding how AI models process language with Query, Key, Value matrices

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in making computational methods accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background. My approach emphasizes:

- **Hands-on learning** through practical exercises and real-world examples
- **Open-source materials** that anyone can use and adapt
- **Building intuition** before diving into technical details
- **Supportive environments** where questions are encouraged
